# OHL Project Week â€“ Soccer Analytics

This repository documents the results of a one-week collaborative data analytics project conducted with **Oud-Heverlee Leuven (OHL)**, a club in the Belgian First Division.

Our team of six worked with match data covering approximately 100 games, aiming to extract insights and explore performance analytics relevant to professional football. The project involved data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and performance metric development.
